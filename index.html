        I worked for MTS for a long time. The moment came when I realized that in my field I had achieved everything.
I went from specialist to Lead of Departments. <br>

            <li>60% of the specialists in my Department got the highest category.</li>
        </ul>	
Then I moved into the field of project management. <br>

A year ago I changed my field of activity to it. Now I work as a business analyst. Having worked in this field, I realized that I like to program.
The first acquaintance with programming languages began with "basic". Then there was the Pascal. Next, according to the plan was the faculty of "Mathematics-Informatics", but the choice fell on the technological University, because it was a victory in the Olympics, and did not have to take exams.
