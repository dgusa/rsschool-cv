* I worked for MTS for a long time. The moment came when I realized that in my field I had achieved everything.
I went from specialist to Lead of Departments.

* **Main achievements in the position of the head:**
* Implementation of the plan by 100 percent or more.
* 60% of the specialists in my Department got the highest category.

* Then I moved into the field of project management.

* **My projects were:**
1. Outsourcing of employees . Result: 20% of the staff is outsourced without loss of customer service quality.
1. A joint project with the company "Belgosstrakh". Result: product "Mobile protection", conversion of 10%.
1. Joint project with Bank Moscow-Minsk. Result: installments at the expense of the Bank's resources, savings on non-returns-2%.
1. A joint project with the company "Carsharing" on the conclusion of contracts for car rental. Result: Profit, image.
1. A joint project with Huawei on staff motivation. Result: marginality growth by 17%.
1. A joint project with Samsung to motivate staff. Result: marginality growth by 23%.

* A year ago I changed my field of activity to it. Now I work as a business analyst. Having worked in this field, I realized that I like to program.

* The first acquaintance with programming languages began with "basic". Then there was the Pascal. Next, according to the plan was the faculty of "Mathematics-Informatics", but the choice fell on the technological University, because it was a victory in the Olympics, and did not have to take exams.

* **In order to understand the field, I constantly study, participate in various seminars/conferences.**
